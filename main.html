<p>
  Since the publication of studies on the subject in the late 1960s by Dr. John Montague, parapsychiatry has been the field of preference for those with adventurous spirit and psychological education in equal measure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some common bases of strong parapsychiatric manifestations:
  </p>
   <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Grief (for example, the infestations experienced by Amelia Vanek)</li>
  <li>Insecurity (originally observed by Montague in his studies)</li>
  <li>Alienation (the Summer Scouts case)</li>
    <li>A denied change in the self (present in the ████ █ expeditions)</li>
</ul>
